# How to think about Cryptonetworks

Time required: 30 minutes.

## 1. There are three camps of how people think about crypto networks.

There's the money crypto camp, the tech crypto camp, and the camp for people who don't believe in the money/tech crypto camp paradigm.

Money Crypto:

> Money Crypto believes that the goal of all this is the introduction of Sound Money -- money with an iron-clad monetary policy that cannot be changed by governments, central-banks, or other entities.

> Money Crypto believes that censorship resistant store of wealth is paramount. This may seem strange to us living in the U.S., where we trust our banks and governments (for now!), but much of the world doesn’t have that luxury: People suffer from corrupt governments, currency controls preventing people from covering capital, and currency inflation due to government instability.

Tech Crypto:

> Tech Crypto, on the other hand, believes we should study the history of the internet -- rather than the history of money -- to help us understand how cryptocurrencies will evolve, and how they will usher in the next epoch of the internet, web3.

> Tech Crypto believes that the internet will only have increasingly more of a say in how power and wealth is distributed, and fixing the incentives (via cryptonetworks) is one of the most important things we can do, along with enabling consumers to own and control their own data.

Neither Crypto:

> There is a narrative in crypto land that you are either in the “crypto is money” camp or the “crypto is tech” camp.

> Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of our portfolio company Coinbase, was interviewed by Fitz Tepper.

> Fitz asked Brian “are you a tech company or a finance company.”

> I like how Brian acknowledges that framework but ultimately concludes that the answer is neither, that Coinbase is a crypto company and that crypto is both tech and money.

> I am of that view as well and I am glad to see leaders in the crypto sector articulating it.

## 2. Cryptonetworks build on each other

One of the things that is most exciting about the crypto ecosystem is the ability for anyone to build on anyone else's work. Here is a clip where Deiter, the CTO of Dapper Labs / Cryptokitties talks about how other developers build new games on top of Cryptokitties without the Cryptokitties team granting access or being a gatekeeper. Watch from 3:00 until 5:25.

This is kind of the dream. In the past, the inability for people to easily build on each other's work was seen as a big deterring factor to innovation. 

> Perhaps the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we are to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others rather than redoing so much of it in a trivially different way. Science is supposed to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of the same kind of things.
