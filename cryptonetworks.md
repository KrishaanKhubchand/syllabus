# How to think about Cryptonetworks

Time required: 30 minutes.

## 1. There are three camps of how people think about crypto networks.

There's the money crypto camp, the tech crypto camp, and the camp for people who don't believe in the money/tech crypto camp paradigm.

Money Crypto:

> Money Crypto believes that the goal of all this is the introduction of Sound Money -- money with an iron-clad monetary policy that cannot be changed by governments, central-banks, or other entities.

> Money Crypto believes that censorship resistant store of wealth is paramount. This may seem strange to us living in the U.S., where we trust our banks and governments (for now!), but much of the world doesn’t have that luxury: People suffer from corrupt governments, currency controls preventing people from covering capital, and currency inflation due to government instability.

Tech Crypto:

> Tech Crypto, on the other hand, believes we should study the history of the internet -- rather than the history of money -- to help us understand how cryptocurrencies will evolve, and how they will usher in the next epoch of the internet, web3.

> Tech Crypto believes that the internet will only have increasingly more of a say in how power and wealth is distributed, and fixing the incentives (via cryptonetworks) is one of the most important things we can do, along with enabling consumers to own and control their own data.

Neither Crypto:

> There is a narrative in crypto land that you are either in the “crypto is money” camp or the “crypto is tech” camp.

> Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of our portfolio company Coinbase, was interviewed by Fitz Tepper.

> Fitz asked Brian “are you a tech company or a finance company.”

> I like how Brian acknowledges that framework but ultimately concludes that the answer is neither, that Coinbase is a crypto company and that crypto is both tech and money.

> I am of that view as well and I am glad to see leaders in the crypto sector articulating it.

## 2. Cryptonetworks build on each other

One of the things that is most exciting about the crypto ecosystem is the ability for anyone to build on anyone else's work. Here is a clip where Deiter, the CTO of Dapper Labs / Cryptokitties talks about how other developers build new games on top of Cryptokitties without the Cryptokitties team granting access or being a gatekeeper. Watch from 3:00 until 5:25.

This is kind of the dream. In the past, the inability for people to easily build on each other's work was seen as a big deterring factor to innovation. 

> Perhaps the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we are to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others rather than redoing so much of it in a trivially different way. Science is supposed to be cumulative, not almost endless duplication of the same kind of things.

One more interesting thought on openness of crypto platforms. Listen from 41:30 -  42:54:

## 3. Understanding Scarcity

In different systems there are different scarce resources. First, listen to this 90 second clip where Alex Danko talks about the scarcity in paradigms before cryptonetworks. Listen from 38:34 - 40:05:

## 4. What's Scarce in Cryptonetworks? Hashrate.

So what's the scarce resource in cryptonetworks? One possibility is that the scarce resource in cryptonetworks is hashrate. Developers and users would opt to build on a network with the most access to hashrate and even play a premium for it in token price, because that is the scarce thing that secures the network.

## 5. Protocols and Networks Accruing Value

This idea is played out in a theory called the Fat Protocol thesis which explains that the value (the scrace resource, hashrate) is in the cryptonetwork, not the overlaying dapps. This is different from in the web, where value accrues in the user facing end applications (think Facebook, Amazon, Google - the biggest tech giants are end user apps).

> The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of "thin" protocols and "fat" applications.

> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It's a stack with "fat" protocols and "thin" applications.

> There are two things about most blockchain-based protocols that cause this to happen: the first is the shared data layer, and the second is the introduction cryptographic “access” token.

## Tokens. Not exactly equity, not exactly a coin-op access token. 

The thing that is new and interesting about tokens is that they are somewhere in-between using a network and investing in the network. Hear Fred Wilson describe it, listen to 30:27 - 32:34:

## In Fat Protocol thesis, the tokens of base networks and protocols accrue value. 

There's a question of how much a token should be valued at in any network. Chris Burniske has a guideline framework:

> Within its native protocol a cryptoasset serves as a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. By definition, then, each cryptoasset serves as a currency in the protocol economy it supports. Since the equation of exchange is used to understand the flow of money needed to support an economy, it becomes a cornerstone to cryptoasset valuations.

> The equation of exchange is MV = PQ, and when applied to crypto my interpretation is:

> M = size of the asset base <br /> V = velocity of the asset <br /> P = price of the digital resource being provisioned <br /> Q = quantity of the digital resource being provisioned

> A cryptoasset valuation is largely comprised of solving for M, where M = PQ / V. M is the size of the monetary base necessary to support a cryptoeconomy of size PQ, at velocity V.

## The best argument against Fat Protocol is Aggregation Theory.
